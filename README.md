This is my first python script, applied to an university exercise.

SETUP:

 - Install Python 2 in your computer and make sure you can run it in Windows PowerShell
 - Modify the molecular weight and amount of each compound (16) in the .txt files
 - Set the location of the .txt list files on lines 15 and 53
 - Modify the parameters on lines 1, 2, 41
 - Open Windows PowerShell and change the directory to the one you have the script
 - Type: python miceCompounds.python
 - Press Enter
